Just to make sure we don't reuse the old venv folder.
First delete the older venv folder.
Sorry, since you'r not running these commands on Unix based OS(Linux, Macos)
some commands are different.

The right command to replace the source venv/bin/activae is the following:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Can you try the following for creating virtual environment and dependency installation on this environment.@
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r fullRequirements.txt
```

Running: Activate v-env and run script
```
venv\Scripts\activate
python scrape_pdfs.py
```
